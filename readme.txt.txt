Hey Liri! (Siri's little cousin)

Used Node.js for the first time to create this command line app that uses Ticketmaster, Spotify, and OMDB APIs to allow users to search for concerts, songs, or movies.

Spotlight: 
Node.js, Axios, Inquirer package, .env/dotenv.

Other tech practice: 
Command Line, JavaScript, GitBash. 

Future development: 
Allow users up to 5 searches before they have to retype their name and password.
